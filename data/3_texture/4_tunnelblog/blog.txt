Intro
I've wanted to write this for some time, but never got around to
it until now.

A while back I saw an impressive fragment shader demo. It was not only visually
amazing, but the number of lines of code it required was impressive. Because there
were so few lines of code, it allowed me to reverse engineer the shader and break it
apart line by line. Once I figured it out, I thought I'd write about it. I did find one or two blogs, but there were not as thourough as I'd hoped. 


Basic
 So let's start with the basiscs. We'll need a sketch, vertex and fragment shader.



Movement
 To add movement, we'll use time.
